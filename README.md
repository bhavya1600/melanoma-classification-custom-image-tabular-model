# Melanoma Classification with Custom Integrated CNN-Tabular Model

## Introduction
This project introduces a groundbreaking approach to Melanoma detection by leveraging a custom integrated model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with tabular data analysis. This hybrid model not only analyzes medical images but also considers critical biological factors such as age, sex, skin color, and other relevant variables to enhance the accuracy of Melanoma classification.

## Technology Stack
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Key Features
- **Custom Integrated Model**: A unique blend of CNN for image processing and a tabular data model to incorporate patient metadata.
- **Enhanced Accuracy**: By considering both image and non-image data, our model provides a more accurate diagnosis compared to traditional image-only models.
- **Comprehensive Dataset**: Utilizes a rich dataset that includes both dermatoscopic images of skin lesions and detailed patient metadata.
- **Interpretability**: Offers insights into the factors influencing the classification decision, making it a valuable tool for medical professionals.
